    <summary><b>The Automation Process:</b> 👈</summary>
      - **Appliance Trigger:**
          - Enter the power sensor entity that measures the live current draw of the appliance. Common devices with these sensors include smart plugs, energy meters, etc.
          - The automation is triggered when the appliance's current draw exceeds a set wattage.
          - The automation ends when the appliance's current draw falls below a set value.
      - **Notification Options:**
          - Send notification messages to one or multiple devices when the appliance starts, finishes or the watchdog is triggered.
          - Your end message can also include estimates of total power consumption and cost.
          - Include duration tracking in your end message to track the appliance's operational time for the task or cycle.
          - Opt to sends a repeated notifications to remind you when the appliance cycle is complete.
          - Limit when notifications can be sent by using Notify Time Restrictions - helpful for avoiding alerts while you're asleep.
          - Notifications are compatible with both Apple iOS and Android devices, ensuring universal accessibility.
      - **Run Status:**
          - Display your appliance's run status on your dashboard.
      - **Notify Time Restrictions:**
          - Restrict notifications to the specified start and end times on the selected days. Notifications outside this time range will be skipped.
      - **Energy Tracking:**
          - Use energy tracking to estimate the total energy usage (kWh) for each completed cycle. You can also choose to include the estimated cost of that cycle in the end notification.
          - Or simply update the start and end helpers without including any energy information in the end notification - useful for your own custom actions or other Home Assistant logic.
          
          ⚠️ **Disclaimer** - These values are estimates and should only be used as a guide. Please avoid relying solely on these estimates for accuracy and use them at your own risk. We cannot be held responsible for any inaccuracies or resulting losses, damages, inconvenience, or anything else that may occur.
      - **Time Tracking:**
          - Runtime Tracking - Records the total runtime of your appliance by updating a text helper each time it completes a full cycle.
          - Duration Tracking - Tracks how long the appliance was running during each individual cycle and includes this duration in the end notification message.
      - **Cycle Counter:**
          - Use the cycle counter to track the total number of cycles completed by your appliance. You can also choose to include this information in your end message.
      - **Service Reminders:**
          - Service reminders help you track appliance usage and perform timely maintenance.
          - Cycle-Based Reminder - Notifies you when a service is due based on the number of cycles completed.
          - Time-Based Reminder - Notifies you when a service is due based on the total time the appliance has been in use since the last service.
      - **Watchdog:**
          - The watchdog option monitors an appliance cycle completion.
          - It sends a notification if a cycle completion fails within the specified time frame.
      - **Device Tracker:**
          - You can choose to use the device tracker for Start, End, and Watchdog notifications.
          - When enabled, only selected devices currently inside the chosen zone will receive those notifications.
      - **Custom Actions:**
          - Tailor custom actions to suit your preferences and needs, enhancing the automation's functionality.
          - Configure actions such as triggering announcements on platforms like The Voice (HA), Google, Alexa, etc., to keep you informed about appliance events.
      - **Custom Conditions:**
          - Enter any custom conditions to further customize the automation process.
